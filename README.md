# üìö Library Management System

A comprehensive, console-based Library Management System built with Java. This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and simulates the essential functions of a university library, from user registration to book borrowing and returns.

The system uses an in-memory `ArrayList` to manage data, making it a straightforward and effective showcase of Java collections and CLI application structure.

## ‚ú® Features

* **User Management**: Add new students to the library system with their name, university roll number, and course.
* **Book Management**: Add new books to the library's collection with a title, author, and unique ISBN.
* **Issue & Return Books**: Seamlessly issue books to users and process their returns.
* **Live Availability Check**: Check if a book is currently available or has been issued to another user.
* **View All Records**: Display a complete list of all registered users and all books in the library catalog.
* **Interactive CLI**: A user-friendly, menu-driven command-line interface for all operations.
* **Pre-loaded Data**: The application starts with dummy data for immediate testing and demonstration.

## üìÇ Project Structure

```bash
Library-Management-System/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main.java       # Entry point, menu loop
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Library.java    # Core logic
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User.java       # Student data model
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Book.java       # Book data model
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Course.java     # Enum for courses
```

## üèóÔ∏è Classes & Relationships
**1. Library Class**
The central engine of the system, managing all core operations and data collections.
```
    public class Library {
        private List<User> users;       // Aggregation: Library HAS-A list of Users
        private List<Book> books;       // Aggregation: Library HAS-A list of Books
    }
```

_Relationships:_
‚úÖ Aggregation with User and Book (Users and Books can conceptually exist without the Library).

_Methods Used:_
- addUser(), addBook() ‚Üí To populate the library's collections.
- issueBook() ‚Üí Finds a user and a book, validates, and links them.
- returnBook() ‚Üí Finds a book, validates, and unlinks it from a user.

_issueBook() Workflow:_
```
graph TD
    A[Find User by ID] --> B{User Exists?};
    B -->|Yes| C[Find Book by ISBN];
    C --> D{Book Exists & Available?};
    D -->|Yes| E[Add Book to User's List];
    E --> F[Mark Book as Unavailable];
```
**2. User Class**
Represents a student member who can borrow books.
```
class User {
    private static Long sequence = 0L; // For auto-generating IDs
    private final Long id;             // Unique, auto-incremented library ID
    private final String name;
    private final Long uniRollNo;        // University-provided roll number
    private final Course course;
    private List<Book> borrowedBooks;  // Association: User HAS-A list of borrowed Books
}
```

_Relationships:_
- ‚úÖ Association with Book (A user can have multiple borrowed books).

_Methods Used:_
- addBook() ‚Üí Adds a book to the user's borrowedBooks list.
- removeBook() ‚Üí Removes a book from the user's list upon return.

**3. Book Class**
Represents a single book in the library's catalog.
```
class Book {
    private final String isbn;          // Unique identifier (Immutable)
    private final String author;
    private final String name;

    private boolean isAvailable;
    private Long bookIssuedToLibraryId; // Tracks which user has the book
}
```
_Relationships:_ 
- A core entity, does not own other custom objects.

_Methods Used:_
- isBookAvailable() ‚Üí Checks the current availability status.
- setAvailable() ‚Üí Updates the book's status when issued or returned.

**4. Course Enum**
A type-safe enumeration to define a fixed set of valid courses for users.
```
enum Course {
    BTECH_COMPUTER_SCIENCE,
    BTECH_MECHANICAL_ENGINEER,
    BCA,
    // ... and others
}
```

_Purpose:_
- Ensures that users can only be created with valid, pre-defined courses, preventing data errors.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
- The application's logic is centered around an interactive loop that processes user commands.
- The Main class initializes a Library object and pre-loads it with sample data.
- A while loop starts, displaying a menu of 8 options to the user.
- The user selects an operation by entering a number (1-8).
- A modern switch statement calls the corresponding method from the Library class.
- The method performs the requested action (e.g., finds a user, updates a book's status) and prints feedback to the console.
- The menu is displayed again, awaiting the next command until the user chooses to Exit (8).


## Application Flow Diagram

```
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Initialize Library};
    B --> C{Pre-load Dummy Users & Books};
    C --> D{Enter Main Loop};
    D --> E[Display Menu Options];
    E --> F{Get User Choice};
    F --> G{Process Choice via Switch};
    G -- 1-7 --> H[Execute Library Method];
    H --> D;
    G -- 8 --> I[Exit Program];
    I --> J[End];

```

## üí° Design Choices & Key Concepts

This project was built to demonstrate several fundamental software engineering concepts using Java.
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): The system is designed with clear object boundaries. User and Book are pure data objects, while Library acts as a service class that encapsulates all business logic, creating a clean separation of concerns.
- In-Memory Database (ArrayList): An ArrayList is used to store the collections of users and books. For a small-scale console application, this is a simple and effective choice. It demonstrates collection management, but it also highlights a trade-off: searching for a user or book by ID requires iterating the list, resulting in O(n) time complexity. For a larger system, a HashMap (keyed by ID/ISBN) would provide O(1) lookups.
- Enum for Type Safety (Course.java): Using an enum for Course ensures that a User can only be created with a valid, predefined course. This prevents runtime errors and invalid data that could arise from using simple String types.
- Static Members for ID Generation: The User class contains a private static Long sequence to automatically generate a unique, auto-incrementing library ID for each new user. This is a simple and effective way to manage unique identifiers without an external database.
- Modern Java Features: The code utilizes modern language features like the Enhanced switch Statement (from Java 14+) for cleaner, more readable control flow and a Labeled break to exit the main loop cleanly.
- Console I/O: User interaction is handled robustly using the java.util.Scanner class.

## üöÄ How to Run

    ```
3. Run the main application:

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Data Persistence: Implement file I/O (CSV/JSON) or a lightweight database (SQLite) to save data between sessions.
- Advanced Error Handling: Add try-catch blocks to gracefully handle invalid user inputs (e.g., text instead of numbers).
- Search Functionality: Add features to search for books by title or author, and users by name.
- Unit Testing: Develop JUnit tests to ensure the reliability of the business logic in the Library class.
- Fine/Due Date System: Implement logic to calculate due dates for borrowed books and manage fines for late returns.
